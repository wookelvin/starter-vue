Howler.js is useful for games. designed around sound sprites
not useful here

## Evaluating Tone.js

https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js/

Helpful for generating sound samples and manipulating it, not so much for multitrack playback specifically

## Evaluating peaks.js

## Evaluate basic web audio api

## there are other solutions that appear to work but need to be demo'd
